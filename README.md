## Let's create our own package manager

* Create a node program
* Check for the first process argument to be init
* If the first argument is init continue processing
* Use readline to ask for 5 inputs
* Create a string that is a json object
* The key values should be the inputs you get from the user
* Save this json to a file called package.json

# Bonus
* Don't use a loop
